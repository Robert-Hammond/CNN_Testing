# Experimentation with Space-Filling Curves
A major difference between some artificial image processors and human vision is made apparent in the "flatten" layers of 
a convolutional nerual network. Translating a 2-dimensional image into a 1-dimensional classification vector is a task that 
makes the use of flattening layers necessary, but they are largely dependent on the size of the image they take as input.
